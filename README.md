## Dropout:
  "Dropping out" neurons forces the neurons around the dropped neurons to pick up on information that other neurons are probably also pick up on. Just like two independent tests is much more certain than one test, dropout gets multiple neurons checking the result, making the prediction more robust to overfitting.
